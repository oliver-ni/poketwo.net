        <h2>Terms and Conditions of Sale</h2>
        <p>
            While we will not charge you a fee to use the basic functionality of the Services, certain products and
            services on the Services are provided on the basis of payment (the "Paid Services"). The fees, duration and
            conditions applicable to the purchase of such Paid Services are described below and in the dedicated
            sections of the Services.
        </p>
        <h4>Product Descriptions</h4>
        <p>
            Prices, descriptions or availability of products are outlined in the respective sections of the Services and
            are subject to change without notice. While products on the Services are presented with the greatest
            accuracy technically possible, representation on the Services through any means (including graphic material,
            images, colors, and sounds) is for reference only and implies no warranty as to the characteristics of the
            purchased Product. The characteristics of the chosen Product will be outlined during the purchasing process.
        </p>
        <h4>Prices</h4>
        <p>
            Stated prices on the Services may not include sales and use taxes. However, users are informed during the
            purchasing process and before order submission, about any fees, taxes and costs that they will be charged.
            We have the right to charge you for any taxes that we are required to pay or in fact collect related to your
            purchase.
        </p>
        <h4>Billing</h4>
        <p>
            We use a third-party payment processor (the "Payment Processor") to bill you through a payment account
            linked to your account on the Services (your "Billing Account"). The processing of payments will be subject
            to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these Terms.
            Currently, we use Stripe, Inc. as our Payment Processor. You can access Stripe's Terms of Service at{" "}
            <a href="https://stripe.com/checkout/legal">https://stripe.com/checkout/legal</a> and their Privacy Policy
            at <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">https://stripe.com/privacy</a>. We are not responsible for any error
            by, or other acts or omissions of, the Payment Processor.
        </p>
        <h4>Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods</h4>
        <p>
            The Services may include opportunities to obtain virtual currency ("Virtual Currency") or virtual goods
            ("Virtual Goods"). Unless otherwise stated, such Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods are not tradable,
            exchangeable or redeemable against any traditional currency, any other digital currency, goods or any other
            values.
        </p>
        <p>
            By purchasing or obtaining Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods, you acknowledge and agree that they may only
            be used within the Services for the purposes expressly authorized by the Company within the Services. You
            may not transfer, purchase, sell, or exchange such Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods outside of the Service
            for value of any kind. Doing so is a violation of the Terms and may result in suspension of your access to
            the Services. The Company retains the right to modify, manage, control and/or eliminate Virtual Currency
            and/or Virtual Goods at its sole discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prices and availability of Virtual Goods are subject to change without notice. We shall have no liability to
            you or any third party for the exercise of such rights. In case of contract or account suspension for any
            cause attributable to you, any and all unused Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods shall be forfeited and no
            refund shall be granted.
        </p>
        <h4>Refunds</h4>
        <p>
            WE DO NOT GUARANTEE ANY REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR FEES ALREADY PAID FOR THE PAID SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
            LIMITATION, IN THE EVENT OF YOUR TERMINATION OR CANCELLATION OF THE PAID SERVICES. WE MAY REFUSE A REFUND
            FOR ANY OR NO REASON WHATSOEVER, AT OUR SOLE DISCRETION. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY OUR REFUND POLICY AT
            ANY TIME.
